# Description
This e-commerce website sells flowers like an online florist but without any function because it is only the front end.

# Personal feeling
This website is the first project that I can visualise because before this, my assignment is all console-based. Although the design and the website are not responsive at all, but it is meaningful to me. 

# This is created by:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

# Example
I only show the Home page because there are too many pages inside.
